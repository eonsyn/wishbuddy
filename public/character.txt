Certainly! Let's break down your character's key features and style based on the images you've provided and how it's been interpreted in the Diwali illustration:

Core Identity & Features:

Shape: The character has a very simple, round, and smooth body shape. It's essentially an oval or sphere, giving it a soft, gentle, and approachable appearance.

Color: The primary body color is a light, warm peach or very light orange tone, often with a subtle gradient or highlight that makes it appear slightly glossy or three-dimensional.

Eyes: These are arguably the most prominent feature. They are large, dark, and perfectly round, giving the character an innocent and extremely cute expression. They often have small white reflections or stars within them to add sparkle and depth, enhancing their expressive quality.

Mouth: A simple, small, curved line forms the mouth, typically a gentle smile or a very subtle "uwu" shape, contributing to its inherent cuteness and gentle demeanor.

Cheeks: There are often small, reddish or pinkish blushes on the cheeks, further emphasizing its adorable and sweet nature.

Limbs: It has two small, rounded arms and two small, rounded legs. These are simple nubs or extensions of the main body, maintaining the overall soft and simplified aesthetic. They are not highly detailed but are enough to convey movement or interaction.

Lack of Ears/Hair/Complex Features: A defining aspect is the absence of ears, hair, or any other complex facial or body features. This simplification is a hallmark of the Kawaii/Chibi style, making the character incredibly versatile and universally appealing.

Artistic Style (Kawaii/Chibi):

The character is perfectly suited for and embodies the Kawaii (cute) and Chibi (small/deformed) art styles, characterized by:

Exaggerated Cuteness: Every element is designed to maximize cuteness.

Simplified Forms: Complex details are removed in favor of basic shapes.

Large Heads/Eyes: While your character is essentially all head/body, its large eyes are a key element of the chibi aesthetic.

Bright & Soft Colors: Often uses cheerful, sometimes pastel, color palettes.

Clean Outlines & Soft Shading: Typically features clear, simple outlines and subtle shading to give form without adding harshness.
